# Inkspire store Analysis ðŸ“Š ðŸ“š
Conducting an analysis of the imaginary Inkspire storeâ€™s performance by creating a dashboard that presents data for marketing managers, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding the optimization of advertising campaigns, promotional strategies, and product assortment.
## Conclusions Based on the Inkspire Dashboard Analysis:

* ### Seasonality of User Activity.
In early December 2020, an increase in user interest in the Inkspire store was recorded, corresponding to the pre-holiday period. This led to a rise in book views, especially of gift editions and holiday sets, as well as an increase in items added to the shopping cart.

* ### Decline in Activity During the Holiday Period.
At the end of December 2020 and the beginning of January 2021, user activity decreased, resulting in a drop in sales volume. This is expected, considering the end of the holiday season and the reduction in purchasing activity.

* ### User Behavior by Product Categories.
Reading accessories (bookmarks, lamps, covers), which are relatively low-priced, are added to the cart more frequently but have a lower purchase conversion rate. Meanwhile, books across various categories (fiction, educational, childrenâ€™s literature) show a higher purchase completion rate and a larger average order value, especially gift editions during the holiday period.

* ### Conversion Funnel.
The funnel reveals that the highest user drop-off occurs at the stages of entering shipping and payment information. This may indicate a need to improve the UX/UI or provide additional information regarding the safety and convenience of the payment process.

* ### Impact of Traffic Channels and Devices.
Users coming from advertising campaigns (source, medium, campaign) exhibit varied behavior: some campaigns generate many views and cart additions but have a lower purchase conversion rate. Additionally, desktop users are more likely to complete purchases compared to mobile device users.
